				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AJATTeer Tom Lazarus (no relation, no known death experiences) shares an insanely great immersion technqiue that he affectionately (and rather pragmatically) dubs &#8220;double-barrelled listening&#8221;. As in, two barrels, like Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s movie characters&#8217; shotguns&#8230;or something&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to the idea of <a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/secret-immersion-technique-multiplexing/">immersion multiplexing (taking multiple simultaneous inputs on the same sensory channel)</a> but madder and Spartaner. Here he is in his own words, sharing the story and benefits of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-hours-building-listening-comprehension">his listening-hearing experiment:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Double-barrelled listening</strong></span> is when you have<strong></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> earphones from one device in one ear and earphones from another device in the other ear.</strong> </span>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with it for a few weeks now and here are my thoughts about it. The thoughts are quite disorganised.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can listen to music + speech. It’s surprising how little they interrupt each other.</li>
<li>You can add instrumental music to speech to pep it up (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/chinese-project-notes-9-making-your-own-music">it’s a bit like doing hand-made mashups, but with only about 1% of the effort</a>).</li>
<li>You can mix “dense” material (e.g, the constant talk of a panel show) with “sparse” material, like a movie or song, so when the dialogue stops in one, you just shift your focus to the other.</li>
<li><strong>You will be very surprised at how easily your brain can jump from one to the other</strong>, and how easily it can tune out one ear.</li>
<li>You will train yourself for those social occasions where you want to follow two conversations at the same table.</li>
<li><strong>Time vampires</strong> I mean colleagues with legitimate concerns of long-range importance are more hesitant to get you to remove your earphones if you have two devices in your ears. I don’t know why.</li>
<li>If you remove one earphone, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/compromise-maintaining-your-immersion-environment-without-completely-alienating-your-fellows%E2%80%A6or-yourself">people are usually placated</a>, and you can immerse in the other ear.</li>
<li>My local Taiwanese radio sometimes flies off into pleasant-but-useless (to someone getting used to Mandarin) English, Taiwanese, Hakka, Japanese, Korean or even Spanish. No worries: the other ear is standing by.</li>
<li>Suppose you’re faced with a short movie on YouTube. Will I like this? Will it have that much L2 in it? <strong>Surf risk-free with the other ear playing something of proven value as backup.</strong></li>
<li><strong></strong>Much of the time seemingly “immersed” when searching by <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/massive-turnover">massive turnover</a> is nothing of the sort. Loading something that isn’t in the language you thought it was gonna be, time spent waiting for something to load, etc. (Have you ever searched for the dialogue in <em>Last of the Mohicans</em> at <a href="http://www.tudou.com/">Tudou </a>buffering speeds? <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-you-should-keep-listening-even-if-you-dont-understand">Hours down the drain…wasted)</a></li>
<li>You can listen to the same clip on repeat ALL DAY and explore new things ALL DAY. THE SAME DAY!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ajatt/status/4772630674542592">Keep L1 audio chaperoned (<span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">suppression</span> <span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">fire</span>).</a></li>
<li>It’s basically MORE L2. How cool is that?</li>
<li>Watching something on your desktop when the phone/doorbell/bladder rings? Normally, that requires a conscious effort to get your mp3 player plugged in, and often you won’t be conscious enough to bother. An mp3 in the pocket is a great failsafe.</li>
<li>Battery and earphone <strong>failures in one device don’t leave you stranded.</strong></li>
<li>It’s much harder to get bored. One thing that gets old quickly + another thing that gets old quickly combine to make hours of not getting bored because you switch between them.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-problem-is-choice">Should I listen to something familiar or something new? BOTH!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-problem-is-choice">Should I listen to comprehensible input or something challenging? BOTH!</a></li>
<li>For tonal languages: music is more memorable and enjoyable, but speech does give me tones, which I want to get used to… BOTH!</li>
<li>“Breaks” used to be silence or L1. Now breaks are just one ear of listening. Psychologically level up.</li>
<li>Words distract my ability to read. Relatively quiet (but still audible) speech, plus relatively loud ambient music overcome this. Should I read or listen? BOTH!</li>
</ul>
<p>Load both barrels… you’ll hit more targets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having not tried this yet, I personally think Tom is crazy. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/do-it-itll-work">And that&#8217;s probably exactly why his idea is going to work <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </a> . As my mentor Akihiro NAKATANI is fond of saying, you&#8217;re not doing it properly unless people are calling you crazy (<strong>you&#8217;re only on the right track if people think you&#8217;re crazy</strong>). To the headphones!</p>
<p>Do you have a technique or success story of your own to share! THEN SHARE, THEN! Let us all know <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  . Comments or <a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/contact">email</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">, your call <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</span></p>
<p>PS: Having tried out Tom&#8217;s ideas deliberately in earnest for a day or so, it&#8217;s plainly obvious that Tom isn&#8217;t crazy at all. He&#8217;s an engineer, not a madman, a pragmatist, not a romantic. What he&#8217;s talking about is the immersion version of what <a href="http://is.gd/f4SCxE">Nassim Taleb</a> has been talking about <a href="http://is.gd/pkgWwg">throughout <i>Incerto</i></a> &#8212; ridding yourself of having a single point of failure.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll definitely do well to have a backup/background immersion source in case the primary one fails due to human or mechatronic error. The latter form of error is surprisingly unrare, <i>especially</i> with newer devices, on which one never seems to be more than a few tracks away from a machine freeze.</p>
<p>Older, more feature-sparse units are decidedly unsexy and don&#8217;t titillate the inner neophiliac, but they&#8217;ve usually had all the kinks ironed out and so tend to be much more reliable. In my case, since earphones and headphones kinda seem to drive me crazy of late (maybe it&#8217;s a phase), I mostly have speakers do my heavy lifting for me &#8212; <strong>multiple devices, multiple speakers</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1) Removal</h1>
<p>This step&#8217;s pretty easy. Super easy &#8212; physically, that is. All you do remove, delete, give away or otherwise destroy all your non-essential L1 materials.</p>
<h1>2) Sequestration</h1>
<p>This is where you basically confine all the materials you didn&#8217;t destroy in step (1) to a specific region of physical or virtual space.</p>
<p>Now, Steps (1) and (2) are pretty standard AJATT practice. They were never named <em>per se</em>, but they&#8217;ve been touched on in old skool documents like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://is.gd/2KRYyK"> The Immersion Environment: Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day…But this isn&#8217;t Rome, so a week should totally do</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="http://is.gd/SMlbtb">Japan is Wherever You Are: 10 Ways to Turn Your Environment Japanese</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/are-you-a-three-day-monk">any three-day monk</a> can remove and sequester. That&#8217;s immersion checkers. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/stop-trying-hard">Now you&#8217;re about to play immersion chess</a>. Here comes the clever part:</p>
<h1>3) Reverse Pollution</h1>
<p>You&#8217;ve done the removal. You&#8217;ve done the sequestration. But sequestration is as excellent as it is dangerous. Why? Well, it&#8217;s sort of like keeping a bunch of &#8220;criminals&#8221; together &#8212; you don&#8217;t correct them, you just turn them into even better criminals. Lie with dogs, catch fleas and all that.</p>
<p>There is perhaps always the danger of a &#8220;relapse&#8221; or &#8220;binge&#8221; back into your L1. Part of the reason we do the removal and sequestration is to suppress the behavioral attraction &#8212; the &#8220;centripetal force&#8221;, if you will, of the L1. But the attraction may remain. And if one does &#8220;succumb&#8221; &#8212; slightly <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-improve-yourself-stop-trying-to-become-a-better-person">moralistic</a> and melodramatic choice of words, I know &#8212; to the pull, then the <strong>purity of the sequestration becomes its very danger</strong> &#8212; you have created an L1-only physical/virtual space that if touched, could set you up for an L1-only chain reaction. So here&#8217;s what you do to fix that:</p>
<p>Go back on the offensive and<strong> &#8220;poison&#8221; (&#8220;pollute&#8221;) your sequestered physical and virtual L1 spaces (rooms, bookshelves, file folders) with L2 material.</strong> That way, if you ever do have an L1 nostalgia binge, it&#8217;s mitigated by L2 content, bringing you back to your goal. It&#8217;s like filling a prison not just with criminals but also with a bunch of &#8220;incorruptible&#8221;, upstanding citizens, to act as a counterweight and a shining example. No, it&#8217;s better than that, it&#8217;s like somehow magically filling junk food with fresh spinach. Yeah, it&#8217;s that cool.</p>
<p>So, put concretely (computer example here), say you have an L1/English media folder, one that for whatever reason was not amenable to outright deletion, one that you&#8217;ve separated off from everything else and put out in the virtual boonies. Perhaps it&#8217;s even off-board, on its own external drive that&#8217;s rarely connected &#8212; so, pretty well sequestered, both physically and virtually. You now go and fill it with L2/Japanese materials as well; you &#8220;pollute&#8221; it with L2 content so that if and when you do access it, there&#8217;s automatic, built-in L2/Japanese &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/?s=suppression+fire"><span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">suppression</span> <span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">fire</span></a>&#8221; going on.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s review.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create and maintain many L2-only spaces in your life</li>
<li>Destroy (uncreate) <em>all</em> L1-only spaces in your life. Invade and pollute them with your L2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, yeah that&#8217;s it! <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  . If you have a cool immersion technique, you should totally share.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I said it. Sacred. For once, I am deliberately courting a dogmatic approach and intepretation of AJATT &#8220;canon&#8221;.</p>
<p>TL;DR: <strong>if ever in immersion doubt, prioritize your ears.</strong> Anchor your ears in your L2. <strong>Where your ears go, your eyes will follow.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_26947" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/suppression-fire-style-immersion/"><img class="size-full wp-image-26947" alt="Japanese Ear, English Eye" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//sensory-split-lhs.png" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Ear, English Eye</p></div>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve often played a game called &#8220;<a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/suppression-fire-style-immersion/">Sensory Split</a>&#8220;. Basically the idea is this: you can&#8217;t always do the &#8220;all&#8221; in &#8220;All Japanese All The Time&#8221;. And that&#8217;s fine. But you can almost always run a &#8220;Some Japanese All The Time&#8221; game. SJATT. Wow, that&#8230;sounds better&#8230;like &#8220;Stir Fridays&#8221; in &#8220;Archer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hold on though, first of all, I want to sincerely thank <a href="http://is.gd/YowN90">Idahosa Ness, a guest contributor over at Benny the Irish Polyglot&#8217;s &#8220;Fluent in 3 Months&#8221; blog</a>. His post on &#8220;<strong>Sound Rehab</strong>&#8220;, which I didn&#8217;t even have to read in full to be totally electrified by (every paragraph contains enough insight to get you off your duff and implementing for days and weeks at a time), is what inspired me to act and reflect and go back to basics on this idea. I could literally quote the entire article and that would be giving it too little credit. So definitely go over there and take a look.</p>
<p>Anyway, so&#8230;dang that article&#8217;s good. Too darn good. I don&#8217;t even feel like writing any more, because Idahosa tells you everything you need to know. You know how, when you&#8217;re a kid, you&#8217;re growing really fast, and changing shoes sizes every 3~6 months, so, like, even though your parents are well-off, they like to act like they&#8217;re not, as if they hadn&#8217;t gotten the memo that they&#8217;re doing well, so instead of buying you &#8220;Reebok&#8221; shoes, they buy you &#8220;Roebuck&#8221; shoes and hope/pretend you won&#8217;t notice because you&#8217;re just some dumb kid that came out of their nutsack?</p>
<p>Well, this article is the Roebuck to Idahosa&#8217;s Reebok. His is the real deal, mine is a pale imitation. But I&#8217;ma do my best anyway. Um&#8230;talking points&#8230;where was I&#8230;so&#8230;OK, yeah, so there&#8217;s this AJATT idea of sensory split. Basically, you can have one sense in your L2 and the other (linguistic) sense in your L1. So, listening to L1 audio books while reading L2 text. Or, listening to L2 audio while reading L1 text. These two processes are affectionately known as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Japanese Eye, English Ear&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Japanese Ear, English Eye&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>They both have the same initials so you can&#8217;t tell them apart. But which of these is better?</p>
<p>Wait, hold on, did I mention how awesome Idahosa&#8217;s article is? No, the man goes deep, he goes into how our entire education system values vision above all the other senses, quite in contrast to all of preceding human history and prehistory (including the &#8220;Classical&#8221; &#8212; Graeco-Roman &#8212; education that is purportedly the foundation of our system), which has always been very aural/oral. And it&#8217;s not just about whether or not a civilization had or valued writing, this visual bias has infected and affected everything, down to how we now read in silence instead of aloud &#8212; apparently that didn&#8217;t used to be a &#8220;thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>As biases go, it (the visual bias) is a relatively benign one, but it still deserves correction. Good news: I&#8217;ve heard it argued by no less than, if I recall correctly, the guy who organizes the TED conferences that YouTube and things like TED are sorta bringing back oral/aural learning, and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I believe it was Earl Nightingale who called audio learning tapes the greatest learning innovation of his time, or something to that effect. And, yeah, for real, the ability to cheaply and effectively &#8220;can&#8221; actual sound and carry it around may well come to rival text and literacy in sheer impact; Nightingale was probably seeing something that we haven&#8217;t even quite begun to fully experience. Of course, the irony of it all, as Mihai Nadin points out in <em><a href="http://is.gd/NM5BnP">The Civilization of Illiteracy</a></em>, is that this putative resurgence of oral culture came about thanks to text &#8212; in other words, what you&#8217;ve got going on is this sort of &#8220;neo-oral culture&#8221; that Walter Ong describes in <em><a href="http://is.gd/CSczcK">Orality and Literacy</a></em>. I said putative, I meant incipient. No&#8230;impending.</p>
<p>Ha. I got to say &#8220;putative&#8221;, though. Looks a bit like &#8220;punani&#8221;, so I like saying and writing it <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>&#8220;This punani resurgence of oral culture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, you were thinking it, too!</p>
<p>OK, so Japanese Ear/English Eye and Japanese Eye/English Ear. Which of these is better? Well, <strong><em>by far</em>, the Japanese Ear/English Eye process is the more powerful one</strong>. If ever in doubt, let your eyes run free range linguistically, but fix &#8212; immerse &#8212; root your ears deeply in Japanese or whatever language it is you&#8217;re trying to get used to. There are several reasons for this, many of which are in my head but only a few of which I can really articulate clearly.</p>
<p>We are a very visual generation/culture of a very visual species and I am certainly no exception to that. As people go, I consider myself a very visual person. I&#8217;m a bibliophile; I buy and read books like&#8230;like dominoes, just one after another. I&#8217;ve had a TV (computer and projector now) in my bedroom since I was 11. I literally go through Tyrone Biggums withdrawal symptoms if I don&#8217;t see kanji for a while. My idea of visiting a city or country is visiting its bookstores. Our work and our play are mediated through literacy; we&#8217;ve all become writers as well as readers, Twittering and Facebooking and texting and generally freaking ignoring me when I&#8217;m speaking: I&#8217;m talking to you, every woman in the world <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  . Even my mother&#8217;s addicted to texting.</p>
<p>And as languages go, I consider Japanese a very visual language, if such a thing can be said. That right there is probably the least controversial AJATT assertion in the history of AJATT assertions. And there&#8217;s no reason, no excuse to remain illiterate in Japanese if getting used to Japanese is something you want to extract out of life, out of your time here on Earth. Nevertheless, like Idahosa, I don&#8217;t buy into the <strong>&#8220;learning styles&#8221; / &#8220;learning modalities&#8221; <em>spiel</em>; it&#8217;s always struck me as just another cop-out, another way for people to claim that they&#8217;re stupid and handicapped and &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; do something</strong>. Almost like a dyslexia lite or an ADD junior. Just yet another sub-clinical &#8220;pathology&#8221;, another &#8220;disability&#8221;, another way to disempower ourselves, to make ourselves weak and broken and&#8230;yeah, lame.</p>
<p>And at the same time, Idahosa&#8217;s helped me understand how/why it is I got addicted to audiobooks these past, I dunno, 18 months or so. <strong>Learning by ear is powerful, just as powerful (and in some ways more so) than learning by eye.</strong> Here&#8217;s the thing about making your ears a sacred L2/Japanese space:</p>
<p>You can listen (well, hear) far more than you read. So there&#8217;s a volume issue. Even with the amount we read nowadays, there are plenty of times when we&#8217;re staring into space or when we simply can&#8217;t read for logistical reasons &#8212; <strong>our hands are literally too full for literacy</strong> (you like it when I do that, don&#8217;t you?). Some people drive, others walk (I read while walking quite a bit, but traffic safety concerns curtail the amount I can get away with this), some people get just too plain tired, either in the eyes or in the whole body. Sometimes we can&#8217;t focus. Again, back to talking about me (my favorite person and topic), I have great vision, but yeah, my eyes tire. Not to mention the biggest visual shutdown of them all: sleep. We even call it &#8220;shut-eye&#8221;. And let me hit you with some knowledge, sister: sleep is a major hole in your reading time.</p>
<p>Ears on the other hand, never get tired. Not in the same way. They can always be kept busy. No matter what you&#8217;re doing. Even when you&#8217;re tired. Even when you&#8217;re walking. Even when you&#8217;re daydreaming. Even when you&#8217;re sleeping. Will you always be focussed? No, but that&#8217;s fine. The same can&#8217;t be said for books, you can&#8217;t passively read in the same way you can passively hear (there is something to be said for &#8220;visual cues&#8221; and &#8220;ambient text&#8221;; they are good and they are valuable; what I&#8217;m talking about here is not about the presence/absence of power and value but about an overwhelming differential in power and value). Aural cues and ambient sound are just that much more impactful.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another interesting thing I find about always hearing your L2. OK, so it&#8217;s easier to keep Japanese or Cantonese or L2ese in your ears at all times than it is to keep it in your eyes, right? No argument there; I&#8217;ve told you nothing new. But here&#8217;s what I find that&#8217;s exciting: always hearing your L2 acts as a reminder that &#8220;hey, we&#8217;re playing the L2 game&#8221;. No, reminder&#8217;s the wrong word. &#8220;Reminder&#8221; is an English word for &#8220;annoying thing telling you what to do but that you ignore&#8221;. Reminders are Google calendars and bossy little sisters <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  . No, it&#8217;s more subtle and powerful than that: it&#8217;s a nudge. A nudger. Mothernudger.</p>
<p>Because, here&#8217;s where it gets weirder, <strong>when I hear, say, Japanese, it makes me <em>want</em> to read Japanese more. It doesn&#8217;t inspire guilt, it inspires desire</strong>: that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a nudge, not a reminder. It inspires behavior. Like, it feels&#8230;right? It feels comfortable? Sort of like how certain foods go better together, or certain foods make you want other foods? Due to my low mental age, I&#8217;ve never drunk or smoked, so I can&#8217;t speak from personal experience there, but I hear, for example, a lot of drinkers who don&#8217;t otherwise smoke say that when they drink, they start to want a smoke.</p>
<p>So, yeah, like that. Like milk and cookies or milk and cereal. Or strawberries and cream.</p>
<p>Big dairy fan talking.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, did you know that Tom Cruise&#8217;s real/government surname is &#8220;Mapother&#8221;? I did not know that. Saw it the other day on WikiPedia Japan.</p>
<p>That totally came up out of the blue. Apropros of nothing. I have no way of connecting it to anything else we&#8217;re talking about here today.</p>
<p>So, yeah, reading even very relaxed, skimmy, AJATT-style reading, is relatively effortful whereas <strong>hearing is extremely effortless.</strong> You have to be in the same room as text and looking at it. Obviously the same is not true of audio, which is not constrained to line of sight, so <strong>it&#8217;s not just a sensory issue, it&#8217;s even a spatial one.</strong> Which is weird because photons are kind of&#8230;I dunno, cooler&#8230;sexier&#8230;than air vibrations but air vibrations are actually&#8230;pretty awesome as a carrier medium for information.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could go into how&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>basically, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">the difference between a native-level speaker and a linguistic foreigner is that </a><strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">the foreigner lacks a critical mass</a> &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/cute-girls-mathematics-language">sheer volume</a> &#8212; of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-you-should-keep-listening-even-if-you-dont-understand">auditory L2 exposure.</a></strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="instead of complaining about how learning is hard and kids have it easier, wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to avail yourself of every advantage that kids have, no matter how trivial? All it takes is using the headphones and speakers you already own anyway! Why wouldn&#8217;t you do that? Why wouldn&#8217;t you do something that doesn&#8217;t require effort? Why do you have to be so theoretically convinced that it works when experience alone is screaming in your face?!
Because, no, I don&#8217;t know the theoretical reasons why hearing/listening works (and linking to articles based on too-brief-to-be-conclusive research would just be me pretending to know), but sometimes common sense alone is good enough. And common sense raises questions like: how could I expect to be able to reach native levels with no reference whatsoever to native method and experience?
Not that everything we do must be a reconstruction of childhood but for crying out loud, it&#8217;s a great starting point! Think about it: every able-bodied person learns their native language to fluency; that&#8217;s a 100% success rate; it is literally the most successful language learning program in human (and perhaps pre-human) history. There&#8217;s bound to be something there worth copying! ! ! With or without understanding it, what works&#8230;(get this)&#8230;WORKS!
I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;&#8230;give it a chance because I have no theory for you &#8212; but the empirical evidence &#8212; in your own personal life, no less &#8212; is over-freaking-whelming; it is over 9000. I&#8217;m not saying the Earth is flat here, man. I&#8217;m saying&#8230;give the idea a chance! 
Why would you happily try drugs and alcohol, which we know are bad for you (but keep trying to prove otherwise), yet turn a schooled, skeptical eye to &#8220;passive&#8221; hearing because you are not 1000% convinced that &#8220;this listening voodoo is gonna do anything&#8221;. I mean, I know &#8220;why&#8221;: people are weird like that; I do plenty of weird things&#8230;but still. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;them Jews got all the money&#8221; but then literally burning a stack of $86,400 in small, unmarked bills that get delivered to you every day because&#8230;because, Phuket, you don&#8217;t like how they look." id="return-note-26940-1" href="#note-26940-1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>audio recordings allow us to get this exposure &#8220;for free&#8221; for next to no effort.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/do-wide-standards-apply-to-immersion-high-achievement-despite-lowwide-standards">auditory exposure acts as a pivot/lever</a>: <a href="http://is.gd/Iiz4Is">a small effort on the front end yielding big results and a cascade of knock-on effects</a> (<strong>like the aforementioned &#8220;hearing Japanese makes me want to read Japanese&#8221; effect</strong>) on the back end.</li>
<li>you don&#8217;t &#8220;learn&#8221; a language: you get used to it. How you don&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221; language, you live it.</li>
<li>all that hearing/listening will provide you tons of opportunities for incidental learning (which is easily 99% of all learning).
<ul>
<li>Plus it&#8217;ll give you <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/no-one-will-ever-love-you-again">opportunities to shadow.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the world is now literally awash in embarrassment of podcast riches, something you couldn&#8217;t have said in 1999.</li>
<li>contrary to popular belief, we are <em>not</em> aware of when and what we are learning.</li>
<li>a lot is happening to us subconsciously, in the background that we neither fully understand nor realize.</li>
<li>in my experience, everyone who sneers at the idea of &#8220;passive&#8221; hearing/listening also curiously seems to suck at every language but their native one (of which they have passively heard a metric crapton)</li>
<li>hearing will inevitably lead to listening</li>
<li>hearing and listening will improve your<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-you-should-keep-listening-even-if-you-dont-understand"><strong> listening comprehension (which, contrary to popular belief, is more important than active vocabulary as a conversation maker/breaker).</strong></a></li>
<li>hearing will allow you to improve your accent and sound more native (both with and without shadowing).</li>
<li>many deaf people, like (for example) Marlee Matlin, who is hot stuff (check out <a href="http://is.gd/RAOxTM"><em>The L Word</em></a>), sound &#8220;weird&#8221; to us when they talk because they don&#8217;t get to use their ears for feedback, and how, <strong>to the extent that we don&#8217;t hear or haven&#8217;t yet heard our L2 enough (volume and frequency of exposure), we are kind of &#8220;deaf&#8221;</strong>, too&#8230;because we haven&#8217;t&#8230;we haven&#8217;t trained the ear to hear those L2 sounds to the point that it can regulate our speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>could</em> go into all of that up there ↑ &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;But I&#8217;m not gonna because my eyes and fingers are tired right now and I can&#8217;t be bothered and I&#8217;m not so hot at convincing people to do things and I&#8217;ve covered some of that ground before and other people are or are going to be doing a better job of talking to you about it all anyhow.</p>
<p>My eyes are tired now and need a rest. But my ears? Still goin&#8217; strong. Still listening to (<strong>hearing &#8212; I&#8217;m not always focussed and that&#8217;s fine</strong>) &#8220;<a href="http://is.gd/fLjPay">Powerpuff Girls&#8221;</a> in Chinese, which has been on this whole time. How do you like them apples? Your ears are your friend: use them.</p>
<p>One more thing: you probably have a life going on in your L1. A life that needs to be attended to. But guess what? Precisely because our modern culture is so visual, even more than it was a generation ago, <strong>you can, in most situations, safely and easily dedicate your ears almost completely to your L2 while having your eyes float in and out of your L2 as necessary to handle your&#8230;yeah, your life</strong>. There remains a good deal &#8212; not too too much, because Japan has a great translation culture, but a good chunk &#8212; of information that I can only access in English. &#8220;Locking&#8221; my ears in L2 mode allows me to read this information guilt-free (yeah, even I have AJATT guilt &#8212; can&#8217;t be a hypocrite, right?) while also naturally, effortlessly and almost imperceptibly pulling me right back to L2 stuff as soon as I have &#8220;done the needful&#8221;.</p>
<p>Listening and hearing stuff makes you want to look it up and google it and wiki it and just generally get more deetz; you keep hearing it, so you keep wondering what it&#8217;s about. <strong>You keep hearing it, so you eventually start saying it.</strong> Anyone who has a baby or a baby sibling knows this is true: yeah, the babies imitate us, but we also imitate them. Many family nicknames are baby-invented mispronunciations. And they tend to stick for life: my middle sister&#8217;s teenhood friends are still calling her what I called her when I couldn&#8217;t talk properly.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing and listening to Japanese</strong> &#8212; and I use this word cautiously but deliberately &#8212; <strong>religiously</strong>, was definitely a (the?) <strong>cornerstone</strong> of the original 18-month AJATT success story and all its side stories (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-watch-the-news-in-japanese">the news success&#8230;like, I <em>pounded</em> the news</a>. And what I did was, watch the news once, record it to MiniDisc (this was a long time ago) and then listen to it all day). If you look through the success stories of other AJATTeers, both in Japanese and other languages, you&#8217;re going to notice a strong aural trend. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/understanding-the-news-james-success-story">James (news</a>), <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-are-what-you-eat-you-write-what-you-read-you-speak-what-you-hear">Jamie </a>(<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-peeing">peeing</a>, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-are-what-you-eat-you-write-what-you-read-you-speak-what-you-hear">German</a>). Errybody. Of course they were visually engaged, too, as was I, but the aural engagement is the real magic. And it is the aural engagement that, I would argue from experiment and experience, drives visual engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Aural engagement drives visual engagement. Not the other way around.</strong> There is a tendency among AJATTeers &#8212; indeed, among schooled people period &#8212; to turn this into an SRS game. All reppy, no heary. &#8220;Just do my reps and I&#8217;m cool, right? Screw all this listening.&#8221; <a class="simple-footnote" title="I actually had a kid contact me who had &#8220;no time&#8221; to listen but wanted to only do reps so he could understand judo material &#8212; text and videos &#8212; in Japanese, because doing reps was something he could &#8220;see&#8221; himself doing whereas listening seemed just silly" id="return-note-26940-2" href="#note-26940-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Wrong. <strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/pay-time-pay-money-dont-pay-attention">SRS is the glue of the metaphorical Book of AJATT but media exposure is the paper</a>.</strong> Think of it as though your ears just got tattooed with Japanese flag colors, and you&#8217;d be on the right track <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-anchors">Anchor</a> your ears in your L2. <strong>Where your ears go, your eyes will follow.</strong></p>
<p>Aural engagement drives all engagement. Again, <strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-dont-have-a-foreign-language-problem-you-have-an-adult-literacy-problem">I am not downplaying literacy in any way. I am literacy&#8217;s bulldog</a>. </strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-wait-that-kills-before-you-pwn-you-must-first-own">You&#8217;re not going to learn to read a language you don&#8217;t get to see that often.</a> And I think ignoring the writing system of a language with any considerable literary output is comically stupid and unnecessary and will also, ultimately, suppress the quality of one&#8217;s speech and even comprehension. You know how native speakers who don&#8217;t read a lot habitually missay (and no doubt misunderstand) certain things? Yeah, like that. You don&#8217;t need that. There is no need to be illiterate. <strong>Writing systems are <em>meant</em> to be understood; they <em>exist</em> to be understood</strong> <a class="simple-footnote" title="Yes, even Chinese-based ones (especially Chinese-based ones &#8212; they&#8217;re trying so hard to help you that they even went and drew you a freaking picture: what more do you freaking want   ?! ) Most kanji/hanzi are actual logical combos of pictures (logograms?), but&#8230;yeah&#8230;the basis is pictographic.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 3 of 3 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/wide-standards" class="series-146" title="Wide Standards">Wide Standards</a></div><p>e_dub_kendo on <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-have-high-standards-have-wide-standards">&#8220;Don’t Have High Standards, Have Wide Standards&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Khatz, just to clarify, this applies to the “study aspect” like doing SRS reps, etc, but given any 86,400 second period one should be striving to be in a Japanized environment for as many of those seconds as humanly possible right?</p>
<p>I guess what I’m saying is, it doesn’t matter how many kanji you learn a day, as long as you learn some, or how many sentence reps you do, as long as you do some &#8212; that totally makes sense to me.</p>
<p>But is immersion different? I know that there have been times when I was tempted to get slack about immersion, to stay in English even after things I NEEDED to do in English were finished, but because I have deeply drilled into myself this instinct to constantly maximize Japanese exposure, I have been able to overcome those temptations to get sucked into the 24-hour <em>NCIS</em> marathon on USA [Network] that was playing in the other room, and etc.</p>
<p>If I’d been taking a less hardcore approach, and expected less of myself in this regard, I can easily see days passing with very little time actually spent in Japanese. Basically doing a small “token” amount of immersion and then saying, well, as long as I do some each day that’s good and then tuning into the <em>Family Guy</em> re-runs (when in the he## is this gonna get a Japanese dub, btw?).</p>
<p>And, I think if my immersion fell apart like that, my SRSing and what-not would follow quickly behind it. Generally, slippery slope arguments are fallacies, but in this case, the pull of English is so powerful it really does create a &#8220;slippery&#8221; condition, I believe, and we must be on guard.</p>
<p>I feel like I haven’t worded this very clearly, but hopefully what I am trying to ask/address is coming through. Thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>To put E-Dub&#8217;s question into 6 words:</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Do &#8220;Wide Standards&#8221; Apply To Immersion?</h1>
<p><a href="http://sylviahenderson.icmembershipsite.com/the-force-of-fulcrums/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6081" title="fulcrum-300x300[1]" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//fulcrum-300x3001.gif" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>They do, actually. In a weirdish way, though.</p>
<p>I currently practice what I like to call &#8220;leveraged immersion&#8221; (mixed with a technique called &#8220;<a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/secret-immersion-technique-multiplexing">multiplexing</a>&#8220;). Leverage in the sense of pivots &#8212; <strong>using minimal effort to get maximum results</strong>.</p>
<p>I have &#8220;wide&#8221; standards in terms of the effort I am willing to expend. But I want to get big results from it.</p>
<p>What does that mean in practice?</p>
<p>When I was in college, doing the &#8220;original, 元祖 AJATT&#8221;, before there was a website or a name for what I was doing, when it was just a personal experiment, a little game, I had traction.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how far I could take it and what would happen if I did. Well, <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E5%8B%9D%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F">I came, I saw, I got used to</a>. The whole of my world was in English and I was in danger of becoming monolingual for the first time in my life. I didn&#8217;t want that. So I playfully&#8230;very playfully&#8230;pushed against it.</p>
<p>Obviously, the experiment produced impressive results, and I wanted to extend it. Higher, further, faster, deeper. More Japanese. More of other languages. A lot of my writing can sound rather fruity and hippie-ish, but there is a side of me that loves the core ideas of organizations like McDonalds and Wal-Mart, that shares the American corporate penchant for massive-scale, plug-and-chug replication and systematization, that makes out with pictures of Ayn Rand taped to my pillow (don&#8217;t&#8230;don&#8217;t judge me).</p>
<p>But the trouble with saying &#8220;no English&#8221; is that it can feel like deprivation at times. It was fine when it was just a game &#8212; &#8220;let&#8217;s see what would happen if I said &#8216;no English&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; but now it feels more like oppressive prohibition than playful restriction. Before I was doing it just because. Now, I&#8217;d doing it because: &#8220;Khatz must practice what he preaches&#8221;. And you&#8217;d be doing it because &#8220;Khatz practiced it and now preaches it&#8221;. Well&#8230;screw that. That&#8217;s dogma. We don&#8217;t need that. We need pragma.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t say &#8220;no English&#8221;. I just don&#8217;t allow English media on any of my good &#8212; best &#8212; machines. I let English exist &#8212; there are business books I need to read that are untranslated &#8212; but I don&#8217;t allow it on my best/most convenient hardware. English can be around, but it has to settle for a second-class existence.</p>
<p>So<span style="color: #ff0000;"> it&#8217;s not &#8220;<strong>no English</strong>&#8220;, it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;<strong>no <em>convenient</em> English</strong>&#8220;</span>. It&#8217;s not &#8220;no English&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;no <em>unaccompanied</em> English&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a <a href="ttp://www.amazon.co.jp/s?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8415&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=80%E5%AF%BE20%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Pareto principle</a> thing. The machines and physical spaces on and in which I spend 80~90% of my time, and which account for the majority of my computing power, have no English going on &#8212; they&#8217;re reserved for Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>So I can watch <em>Family Guy</em> if I want, but it&#8217;ll have to be on my iPad (she&#8217;s been demoted to bi##hbox status), over a Wi-Fi connection, with chintzy speakers, in the kitchen, standing up. Meanwhile <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is the multiplexing part" id="return-note-6080-1" href="#note-6080-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the nice Bose speakers and 90-inch projector screen right next door are playing a Stephen Chow movie. And I can hear the Stephen Chow movie. And there&#8217;s this obscenely comfy beanbag right there, right in front of Stephen Chow. There&#8217;s no competition.</p>
<p>I can watch <em>Family Guy</em> if I want, but there has to be Japanese/Chinese playing and audible at the same time. Maybe some reps going as well. In other words, the English has to be <em>accompanied</em>; it has to have a &#8220;chaperone&#8221;. Case in point: I&#8217;m playing <a href="http://track.webgains.com/click.html?wgcampaignid=42525&amp;wgprogramid=1120&amp;wgtarget=www.yesasia.com/global/search-anime/ghost-in-the-shell/0-0-0-bpt.48_bt.48_q.ghost+in+the+shell_ss.107-en/list.html#&amp;l=1&amp;sb=149&amp;bt=48&amp;ss=107&amp;bpt=48&amp;vn=33&amp;cid=109&amp;s=7&amp;q=ghost+in+the+shell&amp;vm=32&amp;pl=3">Ghost In The Shell (Cantonese version)</a> as I write this English post <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is what we call &#8220;splicing&#8221; or &#8220;sensory split&#8221;" id="return-note-6080-2" href="#note-6080-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What AJATT was and is&#8230;is <strong>total immersion in principle <a class="simple-footnote" title="(and in name)" id="return-note-6080-3" href="#note-6080-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but Pareto majority immersion in practice</strong>. It&#8217;s <em><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%87%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88">de jure</a></em> totality and <em>de facto</em> majority. Now, it happens that:</p>
<ol>
<li>In college, during the original AJATT process, I was always aiming for 100% total immersion, even though I only ever hit it a few times &#8212; Thanksgiving Break, etc.</li>
<li>In college, my apartment <a class="simple-footnote" title="and when I moved into a house, my bedroom" id="return-note-6080-4" href="#note-6080-4"><sup>4</sup></a> was a 100% Japanese zone. It literally was Japanese soil. It was&#8230;I had&#8230;an <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B2%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7">AT field</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="(wow, way too much Evangelion for me)" id="return-note-6080-5" href="#note-6080-5"><sup>5</sup></a> around it and everything.</li>
<li>You (E Dub Kendo) and I have both grown into adults with almost total control over space and time &#8212; we can be wherever we want &#8212; at home &#8212; doing whatever we want almost 100% of the day. We&#8217;re time billionaires (although, as I&#8217;ve discussed before, this actually turns out to be a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done">&#8220;lottery winner&#8221; perspective of our time wealth</a> &#8211; because of overhead and &#8220;time taxes&#8221;, in actuality we have maybe 2~6 hours per day more than regular civilians; we&#8217;re not just rolling in time <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/duck-tales-theme-song-2">like Scrooge McDuck rolls in gold coins</a>, and we can&#8217;t directly re-generate our time through savings and investments).</li>
</ol>
<p>So we feel like we <em>should</em> go for &#8220;total&#8221;, and we feel bad when we don&#8217;t. The only reason we never went total before, the only reason other people don&#8217;t go total is because they don&#8217;t have the control that we do. But we have control. So shouldn&#8217;t we go total? Well, maybe not. Like I said, I have business books to read, seminars to watch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">critical frequency</a>/<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/probability-over-certainty">probabilistic algorithm</a> thing all over again. It&#8217;s engineering (imperfect functional perfection) over mathematics (abstract perfection). <a href="http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/1158529.html">IMHO</a>, we want to approach this like engineers <a class="simple-footnote" title="and statisticians" id="return-note-6080-6" href="#note-6080-6"><sup>6</sup></a>, not mathematicians <a class="simple-footnote" title="Besides, mathematicians seem to go insane and commit suicide at an alarmingly high rate. Forget that." id="return-note-6080-7" href="#note-6080-7"><sup>7</sup></a>. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/cute-girls-mathematics-language">We don&#8217;t need infinity, we just need&#8230;<em>a really large number</em></a>. And&#8230;that metaphorical dirt, that margin of error, that imperfection, that traction, that resistance, that English pimple on our <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;lr=lang_ja&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%E3%83%80%E3%83%B4%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%80%8C%E6%9C%AC%E5%BD%93%E3%81%AE%E7%BE%8E%E3%81%97%E3%81%95%E3%80%8D&amp;biw=888&amp;bih=496&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=KyuhT_eXDKO0iwLMo8CpAg">otherwise-perfect Japanese skin</a>, may turn out to be necessary for us to, I dunno, feel human or something. I sound like an old man now; I&#8217;m old at heart <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>What about the slippery slope? Well, there is none any longer. We&#8217;ve literally <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone">inverted the slope</a>. All convenient paths lead to Japanese. All our best gear is there. You can go English if you want, but it&#8217;ll suck. Who wants to stand up in the kitchen when <em>Evangelion</em> is on the big screen? I certainly can&#8217;t be bothered&#8230;</p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">PS: Should regular civilians &#8212; wage slaves, people at school, etc. try leveraged immersion? Yes and no &#8212; mostly <strong>no</strong>. Certainly not as much as say, housewives and freelancers and NEETs and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4905042097?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8411&amp;creativeASIN=4905042097"><span style="color: #808080;">NR</span></a> people.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 3 of 5 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/engineered-inevitability-2" class="series-145" title="Engineered Inevitability">Engineered Inevitability</a></div><p>Time by itself will do nothing. It&#8217;s engagement or the lack thereof multiplied by time that makes the difference.</p>
<p>So, if time &#8220;is&#8221; anything at all, it is at best a force multiplier. By itself, it&#8217;s powerless. Time multiplied by 0 gives you, well, 0. To mean anything, time needs to be crossed with choice.</p>
<p>Choice is where the real power is.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve waxed pop philosophical enough for one day. Let me wrap it up and bring it home.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; Japanese. Don&#8217;t &#8220;set aside time&#8221; for Japanese. Choose Japanese.</strong> Show up to Japanese. Then, just to be safe, lay down some <span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">suppression</span> <span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">fire</span> &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone">make other choices difficult, inconvenient, or impossible</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What we call time </strong>(in the sense of &#8220;you&#8217;ll get better with time&#8221;)<strong> is not time, it&#8217;s really the sum of our choices. </strong>It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/showing-up">sum of things we showed up to</a>. The sum of our showings up? :P They don&#8217;t have to be big choices. Not at all. They&#8217;re just choices. The simplest choice, the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/atomic-energy">atomic</a> choice, if you will, is a choice of direction. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/identity-and-self-fulfilling-prophecy">The sum of your directions determines your destination</a>&#8230;your &#8220;destiny&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, again, time will not make you better or worse. <strong>It&#8217;s not time, it&#8217;s times: the number of times</strong><strong> you choose</strong> to show up to Japanese &#8211; you will get as good at Japanese as this number is high.</p>
<p>Choose fun. Choose kanji <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently over on the <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt" target="_blank">le das Twitter</a>, the great <a href="http://twitter.com/papajohn" target="_blank">@papajohn</a> and I have been having a ball using Chinglish with each other.</p>
<p>Below are some samples of our exchanges. John&#8217;s messages contained classified information, so I shan&#8217;t reproduce them here. Oh, I didn&#8217;t tell you? Yeah, we&#8217;re totally spies, dude. What, you didn&#8217;t think it was a little weird how invested we were in this whole language deal?</p>
<p>Aaah, screw it. I&#8217;ll reproduce the parts of papajohn&#8217;s communication that have no operational significance. Observe that John and I have generally used one language&#8217;s syntax with the other&#8217;s vocabulary, but we have stretches of full-on Chinese. We also switch across Mandarin and Cantonese, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>John&#8217;s Mandarin isn&#8217;t actually &#8220;transitional&#8221; &#8212; AFAIK, he&#8217;s a Mandarin princeling &#8212; but mine more or less is. Furthermore, we&#8217;re both native speakers of English <sub>[&#8230;oh wait, I forgot &#8212; apparently, according to some people, <em>I&#8217;m</em> not <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />  ]</sub> so&#8230;we have English thoughts <sub>[That doesn't sound dodgy...no siree]</sub>, but we also have Chinese thoughts, having been raised Chinese since the age of twentysomething 8) . A lot of, at least, my motivation, is to communicate directly to the heart and not just the head, so this sometimes becomes a factor in choosing which language gets to be the substrate or lexifier at any given time.</p>
<p>Too many smilies.</p>

Amazon.cn hey? I&#8217;m a Dangdang man myself. Does this mean you&#8217;re riding the 簡體 train?</p>

哈哈 梗唔係啦！只不過係因爲台灣嗰邊 除咗動畫之外 都冇歐美電影嘅國語配音版DVD可以買。 咁所以冇辧法囉～。仲有Amazon.cn好平添。大陸萬歲！呵呵</p>
<p>@papajohn<br />
哦，明白了。大陸的配音是不是跟臺灣的有所不同？我一直覺得臺灣的配音很柔軟、可愛似的。大陸配音北方人多：）<br />

<p>John and I started doing this to save space on Twitter, because Chinese characters can communicate more information in less space. In 140 kanji, you don&#8217;t even have to be pithy; yous can writes yourself a whole mini-essay!</p>
<p><strong>I wonder whether such a mixed approach to output (and maybe even input?) might not be a great way to ease into 使うing your target 言語anguage(?)</strong></p>
<p>In the past, it would appear that a lot of 教育ducation systems around the 世界orld have favoured a cold-turkey approach to second-language/basilectal/dialectal learners of a target language. Barring cases of forcible acculturation, the intent behind this was good &#8212; the <strong>system designers didn&#8217;t want to further encourage or create dialects/pidgins/creoles, so they went straight for the goal.</strong></p>
<p>However, I did recently read about some mixed-usage graded readers for children who are native speakers of the Ebonics dialect of English. If I recall correctly, the readers are initially mostly in Ebonics, and gradually introduce more and more acrolectal [is that even the right word?]/Standard English usage until they are written completely in Standard English. Apparently, they were really successful in getting kids reading acrolectal English with ease and fluency. <sub>[As it turns out, according to some linguists, Ebonics is not mere slang; it&#8217;s actually an entirely self-contained logical-syntactical system, with a relationship to Standard English akin to that of <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9%E3%83%89%E3%82%A4%E3%83%84%E8%AA%9E" target="_blank">Schwizerdütsch</a> to <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E5%BE%B7%E8%AA%9E" target="_blank">Hochdeutsch</a>]. </sub></p>
<p>And that just <strong>seems to make a lot of sense</strong>. On the one hand, mixing is, of course, &#8220;impure&#8221;, heterogeneous, asymmetrical. And that kind of thing doesn&#8217;t appeal to the little zealot inside all of us, that binary part of us that wants everything just so. But at the same time, there&#8217;s just something very <strong>natural and organic and logical and workable-seeming about the whole idea.</strong></p>
<p>Human beings, more often than not, need to be eased into things, I think. Put another way, there&#8217;s far less likely to be a rebound &#8212; much like an organ transplant rejection &#8212; if the transition is gradual rather than sudden. Accomodating this apparently natural tendency can seem like a sort of <strong>half-buttocked mishmash compromise (and it can end that way if the transition window stops moving)</strong>, but ironically enough it can also lead to rain on wedding days, free rides when you&#8217;ve already paid, and true, permanent behavior change in a way that coercion often does not. <strong>Coercion produces resistance. Well-executed gradual change can bypass this resistance completely.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Frog in hot water. Frog in water that gradually gets hotter.</p>
<p>This gradualism thing, we are seeing, is true of children, and I think it may be even more true of adults. Not because adults are less malleable or resilient than kids or any other ageist crap like that, but because <strong>adults have the power to resist and escape</strong>. I&#8217;ve seen this with training my two cats, who are of different ages: it&#8217;s not actually &#8220;easier&#8221; to train kittens &#8212; they have short attention spans and less background knowledge &#8212; but kittens aren&#8217;t as strong as adult cats, so you can&#8230;you know&#8230;literally put them right where you want them. With adult cats, on the other hand, you kind of have to coax and negotiate and reason, otherwise you will get the scratch, motherlover.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Babies can&#8217;t turn off their immersion environment. Babies can&#8217;t build their own gaijin bubbles.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>So, kids, 次回ext time you&#8217;re at a loss for 詞words&#8230;try mixing 言語anguages. <strong>Of course, you want to get to the stage where you use or can use just the one. But for now, treat it as a phase you&#8217;re going through.</strong></p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;ve already done this mixing before, but in analog form &#8212; when I was in college, I would take coursework notes in a hybrid kanji-katakana-Latin [in order of priority/abundance] shorthand, making and using words very loosely in a highly personalized, idiosyncratic sort of way; I&#8217;d often make up original kanji compounds on the spot.</p>
<p>When you think about it, until your vocabulary matures and fills out, you&#8217;re already a <em>de facto</em> &#8220;transitional user&#8221; of your target language. The only question is: do you now recognize and exploit this fact, or do you suppress it out of fear of the risk involved? As it is, with conventional methods, many people give up learning their target language and thus remain &#8220;transitional&#8221; for life <em>anyhow</em>. But acknowledging this &#8220;middle passage&#8221; through language-mixing may have the paradoxical effect of carrying more people through to full fluency than a strict language separation.</p>
<p>Anyway, food for thought. Anyone with information to share, go ahead and 發言launch words! Oh yeah &#8212; sorry for being autological; I know that annoys some people. Or maybe it&#8217;s my inner purist that&#8217;s annoyed. Yeah, it&#8217;s probably just me. Oh well&#8230; <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<li>&#8220;Delete bad SRS cards or they will deplete you&#8221;.<br />
Momoko <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6855589418">#</a></li>
<li>Watching a Korean drama in Cantonese&#8230;Bobby Lee wasn&#8217;t kidding. It&#8217;s been 10 minutes and three well-chiseled men have cried already. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6874082348">#</a></li>
<li>I am feeling this rather intense desire to end my sentences in &#8220;innit?&#8221;.<br />
可笑しいｲﾆｯ <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6887904272">#</a></li>
<li>An SRS deck is a fluid, living system. It is natural that unhealthy &#8220;waste&#8221; products (bad cards) be removed for the health of the whole. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6905053183">#</a></li>
<li>The excuse you make today for why you &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; do something may one day be used as a reason to prohibit people like you from doing that thing <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6919626261">#</a></li>
<li>Excuses abound. Age is one of them. Ethnicity is another. Take them if you want. They only invite discrimination, and they only hurt you. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6921042679">#</a></li>
<li>Excuses only hurt you. I don&#8217;t care if you think you&#8217;re &#8220;too old&#8221;. But is that the life you want? Forever helpless and hopeless? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6922349338">#</a></li>
<li>Being misunderstood online is really annoying. Attempts to clarify the misunderstanding tend to fail.<br />
Conclusion: fora = huge waste of time <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6922530943">#</a></li>
<li>Many of us expatriates are acutely aware of our image in the host country. But we rarely seem to propose acting on (cont) <a href="http://tl.gd/1aur4" rel="nofollow">tl.gd/1aur4</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6922827867">#</a></li>
<li>西洋ではよく、日本人が排他的な民族だという。しかし仮にそうだとしても、その排他性が無ければ、世界中の「先住民族」と同様に疾っくに侵略・奴隷化・虐殺される破目になっていただろう。適切な警戒心があったからこそ、日本の言葉・文化・民族が無事生き残れたのではないか。 <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6923873730">#</a></li>
<li>Proper nouns are important to learn, too. Ever met a person from Japan who can kind of read English, but can&#8217;t sound out &#8220;Caroline&#8221;? Yeah&#8230; <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6924304858">#</a></li>
<li>Every moment you spend making excuses is a moment you could spend solving the problem. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6926069915">#</a></li>
<li>I’ve said this before, but never loud enough: TRAVEL PHRASEBOOKS ARE A GREAT SOURCE OF SENTENCES for SRSing. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6926381869">#</a></li>
<li>Maybe your parents didn&#8217;t give you every freaking opportunity in the world as a kid. But what have YOU done to parent yourself? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6927460107">#</a></li>
<li>Are you being a good parent to yourself? Or do you keep abusing yourself with assurances that you are a hopeless loser? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6928714602">#</a></li>
<li>&#8220;Many a man has taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first.&#8221;<br />
Emerson <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6929463609">#</a></li>
<li>You already own a time machine. It&#8217;s called &#8220;this moment&#8221;. Get inside it, and you can alter the future. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6931898192">#</a></li>
<li>Today&#8217;s &#8220;valid&#8221; excuse to limit yourself is tomorrow&#8217;s reason to bar you from social advancement. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6933669526">#</a></li>
<li>Do you want to live a life where everything &#8220;should&#8221; have been done in your childhood but is now conveniently &#8220;too late&#8221; to start? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6935421075">#</a></li>
<li>Animaniacs in Japanese! Thanks Ed!<br />
<a href="http://bit.ly/5Z0BYJ" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/5Z0BYJ</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6937255500">#</a></li>
<li>Do you want to live a life that is the negative sum of the extracurricular lessons your parents failed to provide you as a child? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6941492398">#</a></li>
<li>Today, you&#8217;re telling yourself you can&#8217;t learn Japanese. Tomorrow, Japanese people are refusing you work because you &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; learn Japanese. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6944799072">#</a></li>
<li>『中には、「暗記は思考ではない」と考える人も居るでしょうが、・・・・学習は先ず暗記から始まるのですから、其処で集中出来ない様では創造性など育たない』http://bit.ly/6dvg89 <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6948026155">#</a></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t lower your expectations per se. Shrink them. And then repeat a chain of these shrunken expectations. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6951372287">#</a></li>
<li>Reading is certainly a worthwhile pastime, but most books simply aren&#8217;t worth reading. Your job is to find the ones that are. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6954639926">#</a></li>
<li>ユーチューブの言い争い面白いね（笑）。押し並べて低俗だが、偶には巧みな言い回しを披露する奴も居る。まあ殆ど無いけど・・・ってか一層の事コメント機能自体を制限するか、無効にした方がいいかも。ちゃんと制限してないから馬鹿が蔓延るんだよ。<br />
或る意味で制限があってこそ初めて自由がある。 <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6957093971">#</a></li>
<li>I might be wrong about everything. Keep that in mind whenever you read my stuff. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6957247480">#</a></li>
<li>ザ＝シンプソンズって、面白かったり皮肉を込めたりするとは言え、最終的にゃ滅っ茶苦茶アメリカの「中流の平凡さ」の肯定論だね。「何も変えなくていいぞ」、「そういう他人どころか自分の生活向上にまで無関心な貴方は、いいよ」って。一代にして億万長者になった人達が言うべき事じゃないだろう。 <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6958180108">#</a></li>
<li>At one time, it was illegal to teach foreigners Japanese. Why? Because (1) They had bad intentions, and (2) They had the ability to learn it <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6959310131">#</a></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to get it all done. Don&#8217;t even try to do the most important thing. Just do one, tiny thing that moves things forward. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6960426977">#</a></li>
<li>I think I&#8217;m far too pessimistic on the multiple simultaneous language thing. Having said that, I do think a staggered start is best. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6961220345">#</a></li>
<li>「傳說中有一個傳說中嘅戰士。佢嘅功夫勁到好似傳說中嘅傳說一樣！佢到處流浪去搵武藝高強嘅對手・・・」http://bit.ly/7gnVYb <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6963509386">#</a></li>
<li>Perhaps there is such a thing as on optimal load of simultaneous languages. Too many and you&#8217;re overwhelmed. Too few and you&#8217;re bored. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6966531766">#</a></li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a &#8220;good book&#8221; or a &#8220;classic&#8221;. If the pages aren&#8217;t moving, it&#8217;s time to move it out and move on. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6970061012">#</a></li>
<li>The longer the road, the nicer you need to be with yourself. You can&#8217;t make it there without you. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6972733649">#</a></li>
<li>For success with AJATT, I think the most appropriate attitude is one of experimenter. You&#8217;re not just dutifully ex (cont) <a href="http://tl.gd/1bd7k" rel="nofollow">tl.gd/1bd7k</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6973730031">#</a></li>
<li>Screw around. You don&#8217;t have to absolutely know what you&#8217;re doing&#8230;that&#8217;s why you screw around &#8212; to find out. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6975116950">#</a></li>
<li>Language knowledge is like a <span class="search-everything-highlight-color" style="background-color:orange">fire</span>. It needs heat (interest), fuel (media) and oxygen (fun). <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6976476475">#</a></li>
<li>Tools are great. But remember &#8212; you&#8217;re the most important tool of all. You tool. <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6976513541">#</a></li>
<li>If your parents had forced you to learn Japanese as a child, you&#8217;d have hated them and skipped out on it anyway. So, no more &#8220;if onlys&#8221;. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6979619746">#</a></li>
<li>I wish more of the cool stuff that goes on in the world would get recorded <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  . <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6982749468">#</a></li>
<li>Updated the AJATT FAQ. Just FYI. It&#8217;s a bit less OTT than before. I hope this isn&#8217;t TMI&#8230;<br />

<li>Ever notice how long lifelong-active academics (e.g. Erdos, Chomsky, Chalmers Johnson) seem to live, despite not being very fit? <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6989555729">#</a></li>
<li>When I say &#8220;do whatever you want&#8221;, what I really mean is &#8220;try whatever you want&#8221;. Run experiments. You may discover something. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6992565232">#</a></li>
<li>Japanese governments of centuries past would not have made it illegal to teach foreigners Japanese if they weren&#8217;t capable of learning it. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6994680535">#</a></li>
<li>I think the most frustrating thing about learning a language is how big you can think and how small you can actually act. <a href="http://twitter.com/ajatt/statuses/6997128187">#</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In &#8220;the literature&#8221; (a lot of it <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/ajatt-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=87" target="_blank">very good literature, like <em>Talent Is Overrated</em> and <em>The Talent Code</em></a>), it&#8217;s often said that, you know, we need to do &#8220;deliberate practice&#8221;, meaning stuff that&#8217;s actually a little hard and painful for us. Through deliberate practice, we grow. The reason pros get good and amateurs don&#8217;t is because they don&#8217;t do enough of this deliberate practice.</p>
<p>Apparently, the amateurs stay in their &#8220;comfort zone&#8221;, doing easy things, and so never grow. The pros, meanwhile, &#8220;stretch themselves&#8221;, by working effortfully in their &#8220;growth zone&#8221;; leaving their comfort zone makes them stronger, faster, longer, thicker and harder.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;How do I put this politely&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Bollocks.</strong></p>
<p>OK, &#8220;bollocks&#8221; is a strong word. It&#8217;s just, the thing is that these ideas are well and good in principle, but in practice they only hurt people. In practice, they will not get anyone to independently do what they need to do to reach pwnage. In practice, they boil down to a re-affirmation of a pattern of behavior that I rather prejudicially like to call ASM: &#8220;Anglo-Saxon Masochism&#8221; <sub>(<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-african-way-of-learning-just-do-it" target="_blank">here we go again</a>)</sub> &#8212; what many often call the &#8220;Protestant/Calvinist work ethic&#8221;: no pain, no gain, bee arch; suffering breeds character, mofo.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>in the absence of violence, fear and/or coercion (preferably all three), these ideas aren&#8217;t going to help anyone.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: if you have someone there in your life who&#8217;s constantly ready and willing to beat, scare or otherwise force you into working, then ASM <em>will</em> be effective. Very effective <sub>a few people may die or suffer nervous breakdowns, but we usually just call that &#8220;natural selection&#8221;</sub>. Many of the very best-regarded sports teams, schools and military organizations use it all the time.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t work like that &#8212; not independently. And I know you can&#8217;t, either. And I don&#8217;t want to live with fear, violence and coercion. Indeed, as soon as the apparatus of violence/fear/coercion is removed, many (former) sportsmen and soldiers become, well, fat people with lots of funny stories to tell about the good old days. And many former students become, well, fat people who used to know calculus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com"><img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/zones1.png" alt="Zones Diagram 1" width="510" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>We who speak English natively &#8212; and are therefore participating in the same wider society &#8212; have probably had some degree of ASM culturally ingrained in us; we&#8217;ve been indoctrinated pretty well. That&#8217;s why you and I have had so much trouble doing things you otherwise want to do &#8212; like acquire some form of knowledge or skill, or produce some kind of product or performance.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s review. Simplistic cultural generalizations aside, here&#8217;s the deal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of our training, our default pattern is to use fear, coercion and violence on ourselves.</li>
<li>The idea of comfort zone, growth zone and panic zone is probably accurate.</li>
<li>But, because of (1), <strong>too many of us think our panic zone is our growth zone</strong>. Put another way, we suck at measuring the distance between the comfort zone and the growth zone. In fact, it turns outs that the comfort zone and the growth zone are incredibly close together. <strong>What you think is your comfort zone is probably your growth zone</strong>; sustainable &#8220;deliberate practice&#8221; is much easier and much more enjoyable than most people are currently led to believe. Yes, as simple as a <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/g.htm" target="_blank">cloze deletion</a> or a sentence recognition card is, you are actually learning. In fact, just for kicks I would like to rename the zones, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Comfort Zone  → Boredom Zone</li>
<li>Growth Zone → Enjoyment Zone (aka The True Comfort Zone)</li>
<li>Panic Zone → Panic Zone (aka Pain Zone)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/zones2.png" alt="Zones Diagram 2" width="510" height="367" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like this &#8220;no pain, no gain&#8221; crap. And we don&#8217;t need it. Comfort and growth are not mutually exclusive. Discomfort and growth are not the same thing &#8212; if they were, people with ill-fitting shoes would be the happiest, most successful, most productive in the world <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . Growth feels good. Or, at least, it can. <strong>Amateurs don&#8217;t fail to get good because they stay in their &#8220;comfort&#8221; zone,</strong> they fail to get good because either:</p>
<ol>
<li> They stay in their &#8220;boredom&#8221; zone, and this leads them to put in less time, or</li>
<li>They never feel right about spending more time on the activity <em>because</em> it&#8217;s so much fun &#8212; I have friends who could be professional writers who actively choose to avoid writing <em>because</em> &#8220;it&#8217;s fun&#8221;, or</li>
<li>Constant <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/boiling-water" target="_blank">reboiling</a> and <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/are-you-a-three-day-monk" target="_blank">three-day monking</a>. They do eventually put in enough time, but it&#8217;s dissipated over far too many years to reach &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-you-should-keep-listening-even-if-you-dont-understand" target="_blank">critical mass</a>&#8220;. All human skill is depends on memory in some form. Think of this memory as, to mix metaphors, a puddle of radioactive material. We need to add to this puddle faster than decay or evaporation can do away with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>So, how do we get to that true comfort = enjoyment = growth zone? How do we get so that we&#8217;re consistently doing something? I&#8217;d give you a complicated formula, but neither you nor I would remember it, and what good is a good idea that you can&#8217;t keep in your head, ready to use, right? So here is what I do:</p>
<p>Set <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/showing-up" target="_blank">appearance/situational/environmental goals</a> rather than action/completion goals.<strong> Rather than setting a goal to do the right thing, set a goal to be in the right place. Set a goal to show up.</strong> No more. NO MORE. Don&#8217;t get clever. Don&#8217;t try to achieve. As soon as you start getting clever and adding stuff, your body will rebel.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to run tomorrow morning. You just have to have your shoes on and be standing outside.</strong> You don&#8217;t have to eat healthy food, you just have to have (only) healthy food in your house. Once you&#8217;ve fulfilled the situational goal, you can go back inside to eat potato chips (oh, wait&#8230;none in the house &#8212; better run to the grocery store to get some) and watch <em>Robot Chicken</em> (oh wait, I only have Japanese versions&#8230;) if you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/scales.png" alt="Background image courtesy of FreeDigitalPhotos.Net" width="483" height="360" /></p>
<p>You may think just &#8220;being there&#8221;, standing outside with your shoes on, doesn&#8217;t do anything, and doesn&#8217;t achieve anything. And you&#8217;re right. But you&#8217;re also wrong. Because by being there you have done some incredibly profound scale-tipping &#8212; <strong>you have made it easier to do something, than to not do it</strong>. You have turned an uphill mountain hike into a playful, downward slide. You are now working with gravity, instead of against it.</p>
<p>This is how and why I &#8220;executed&#8221; and continue to execute my Japanese project so well. I never set a goal to even listen to a specific number of hours of Japanese. That&#8217;s <em>far</em> too mendokusai. Count? Are you joking? This isn&#8217;t effing <em>Sesame   Street</em>. I simply set a goal to be in a position/location such that there was Japanese entering my eyes and ears. My goal was to either be in a room where Japanese sounds could be heard, or to have my headphones on and Japanese playing in them (my music player only had Japanese things on it, so this was cake).</p>
<p>This is also why it was actually easier for me to go &#8220;all Japanese&#8221; than &#8220;some Japanese&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;all Japanese&#8221; requires no management overhead whatsoever. The only &#8220;management&#8221; I did and do was shopping for more Japanese stuff. And we all love getting new stuff <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>Can you see the difference?</p>
<p>Situational/environmental goals are actually very powerful. And people already recognize their negative power; they just don&#8217;t realize that they also have positive power. Do you know why your parents didn&#8217;t let you hang out with the bad kids? Not because you were actively going to do bad stuff, but because simply being with the bad kids was enough such that the situation would almost inevitably take itself in a bad direction, with or without your intervention and good intentions.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t work to achieve something. Let the environment do the work for you.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do the right thing. Just be in the right place.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t change yourself. Just change your surroundings. <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bregman/2009/03/the-easiest-way-to.html" target="_blank">Your surroundings will then change you</a> &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/ajatt-twitter-tweets-for-week-of-2009-08-08" target="_blank">always</a>.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s hit out some more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad goal: Do/finish something.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good goal: Be where things (really) get done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad goal: Listen to Japanese.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good goal: Have (only) Japanese to listen to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad (action) goal: Read Japanese.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good (situational) goal: Have (only) Japanese books to read. <sub>Every-freaking-where &#8212; bag, bookshelf, bedroom, bathroom, car.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad (action) goal: Do SRS reps.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good (situational) goal: Have (only) SRS window open.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad (action) goal: Go somewhere.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good (situational) goal: Be in car. Be outside with shoes on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Bad (action) goal: Write book.</li>
<li> <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  Good (situational) goal: Be at desk with writing tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, set up the right system (this does require some effort, but very little &#8212; we have a lot of economic/technological infrastructure that makes this very easy for us), and then let the system&#8217;s inertia carry you all the way to your goal. The other cool thing is that you get you get an <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games" target="_blank">instant &#8220;win&#8221;</a>, you don&#8217;t have to wait to get something &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;finished&#8221;, to feel good.</p>
<p>There are no guarantees in terms of quantity and speed, but &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/little-and-often" target="_blank">little and often</a>&#8221; is more than good enough in most situations. As I always say: <strong>no project ever dies of malnutrition, only of complete-and-absolute starvation</strong>. Most things fall through not because someone was doing too little, but because he wasn&#8217;t doing anything <em>at all</em>. Most people don&#8217;t fail at scheduling because of being bad at scheduling, but because they never even <em>look</em> at the schedules they so lovingly made.</p>
<p>Each of us is like a river. We want to take the proverbial path of least resistance. Trying to use our willpower all the time &#8212; trying to &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;finish&#8221; things &#8212; is like trying to get the cooperation of every molecule in the river at every turn: tiring. By changing our environment, we basically tweak the path in small, simple but significant ways. And then we can go back to being our lazy selves for the remaining ~99% of the time, sliding down a path that we have altered to lead us right where we want to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/managing-greed-how-to-deal-with-your-language-lust" target="_blank">Be your river-like self</a>. <strong>Don&#8217;t climb up to Japanese. Slide down into it.</strong> Don&#8217;t know how? Think something up, try something out. That 1300 grams of meat inside your skull isn&#8217;t for decoration and it isn&#8217;t for slogging; it&#8217;s there for making your life simpler, easier and happier <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
<p>If you identify and take care of the preconditions, then goal achievement can happen as a side-effect, as an afterthought &#8212; as if you weren&#8217;t even trying (and, in truth, you won&#8217;t be).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my two cents. You guys always give great feedback, so I&#8217;m excited to hear your stories and advice <img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  .</p>
